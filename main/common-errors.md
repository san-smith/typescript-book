# Common Errors

In this section we explain a number of common error codes that users experience in the real world.

## TS2304

Samples:

> `Cannot find name ga` `Cannot find name $` `Cannot find module jquery`

You are probably using a third party library \(e.g. google analytics\) and don't have it `declare`d. TypeScript tries to save you from _spelling mistakes_ and _using variables without declaring them_ so you need to be explicit on anything that is _available at runtime_ because of you including some external library \([more on how to fix it](../type-system/intro/d.ts.md)\).

## TS2307

Samples:

> `Cannot find module 'underscore'`

You are probably using a third party library \(e.g. underscore\) as a _module_ \([more on modules](../project/modules/)\) and don't have the ambient declaration file for it \([more on ambient declarations](../type-system/intro/d.ts.md)\).

## TS1148

Sample:

> Cannot compile modules unless the '--module' flag is provided

Checkout the [section on modules](../project/modules/).

## Catch clause variable cannot have a type annotation

Sample:

```javascript
try { something(); }
catch (e: Error) { // Catch clause variable cannot have a type annotation
}
```

TypeScript is protecting you from JavaScript code in the wild being wrong. Use a type guard instead:

```javascript
try { something(); }
catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof Error){
    // Here you go.
  }
}
```

## Interface `ElementClass` cannot simultaneously extend types `Component` and `Component`

This happens when you have two `react.d.ts` \(`@types/react/index.d.ts`\) in the compilation context.

**Fix**:

* Delete `node_modules` and any `package-lock` \(or yarn lock\) and `npm install` again.
* If it doesn't work, find the invalid module \(all modules used by your project should have `react.d.ts` as a `peerDependency` and not a hard `dependency`\) and report it on their project.
