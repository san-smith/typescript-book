# Truthy

JavaScript has a concept of `truthy` i.e. things that evaluate like `true` would in certain positions \(e.g. `if` conditions and the boolean `&&` `||` operators\). The following things are truthy in JavaScript. An example is any number other than `0` e.g.

```typescript
if (123) { // Will be treated like `true`
  console.log('Any number other than 0 is truthy');
}
```

Something that isn't truthy is called `falsy`.

Here's a handy table for your reference.

| Variable Type | When it is _falsy_ | When it is _truthy_ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `boolean` | `false` | `true` |
| `string` | `''` \(empty string\) | any other string |
| `number` | `0`  `NaN` | any other number |
| `null` | always | never |
| `undefined` | always | never |
| Any other Object including empty ones like `{}`,`[]` | never | always |

## Being explicit

> The `!!` pattern

Quite commonly it helps to be explicit that the intent is to treat the value as a `boolean` and convert it into a _true boolean_ \(one of `true`\|`false`\). You can easily convert values to a true boolean by prefixing it with `!!` e.g. `!!foo`. Its just `!` used _twice_. The first `!` converts the variable \(in this case `foo`\) to a boolean but inverts the logic \(_truthy_ -`!`&gt; `false`, _falsy_ -`!`&gt; `true`\). The second one toggles it again to match the nature of the original object \(e.g. _truthy_ -`!`&gt; `false` -`!`&gt; `true`\).

It is common to use this pattern in lots of places e.g.

```javascript
// Direct variables
const hasName = !!name;

// As members of objects
const someObj = {
  hasName: !!name
}

// e.g. in ReactJS JSX
{!!someName && <div>{someName}</div>}
```
